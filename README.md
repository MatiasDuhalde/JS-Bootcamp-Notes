## Overview

This repository contains the notes I took, course resources (generally modified by me), and the final result I achieved in every project this course proposes.

## Part 1
This part of the course mainly focuses on the main tools of the language and programming theory. Its main focus is to give a broad overview on the core tools JavaScript has to offer. While its mostly theory taught with slides (not included in this repo) and small snippets, it also has "small" projects to test and mesure the knowledge of the topics during this part. The first half of this part focuses mainly in JavaScript and its concepts, while the second half starts to include more components focused in web development, namely HTML and CSS.

This repository includes the notes I took from the videos. These are in format of JavaScript comments and snippets. Some sections also include the final result of the mini-projects I mentioned before.

## Part 2
The second part of the course focuses on practice exercise (heavily guided by the instructor). The theory is limited to small reminders along the way of the topics covered in part 1. The projects are mainly explained via diagrams and quick demos, which make everything easy to understand and follow. It not only focuses on getting the thing done, but also on the creative process, basic intuitions, general design, and recommending an approach to take, from an engineering point of view.

Each subdirectory in this part is a different project. This repository contains the final result and the completed project of each section (often slightly different from the actual solution the course offers).

## Conclusions
This is a very good course. Although it might be slow at times. I took it after having a decent amount of programming experience, and some parts, specially in the beginning, were slow from my point of view, so there was a lot of skipping. I was more interested in how to do stuff with JS specifically, than general programming topics like conditionals, loops, OOP, etc. The second part (and the second half of the first part) helped a lot to set everything I learned in concrete. The projects are well thought and structured, and Stephen Grider presents them well and in an understandable way to students.

It's been a while since it was released, so the course does not see much activity from the instructors. Despite that, in general all the questions that might pop up in your head have already been asked and answered (but you'll have to dig deep in the Q&A section to find them). 

I'm not sure when the course was released, but mostly everything is ES6 compatible. There are a couple things in code that the videos show that are currently deprecated (according to MDN), but those things are still supported in most browsers (I'd still recommend learning a more modern approach). For example, to recognize key presses the course uses the `keyCode` attribute (deprecated), while the modern and better approach would be using the `code` attribute.

Definitely, the strong part of this course are the projects, you can find tutorials in youtube for everything in part 1, although Colt Steele explains everything in a way really easy to understand, so i'd still recommend this course over random YouTube tutorials, if your aim is only learning JS, the basics and the syntax.
